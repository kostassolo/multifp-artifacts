# Harnessing Multiplicity: Granular Browser Extension Fingerprinting through User Configurations - Artifacts Page
This is the artifacts page for the ACSAC submission titled "Harnessing Multiplicity: Granular Browser Extension Fingerprinting through User Configurations.


## Summary

Our paper introduces a technique for extracting multiple signatures of each extension by applying different configuration options.  We include here 5 extensions of different option sizes,  along with their configuration options and the resulting signatures. 

We also provide a simplified honeypage for extension testing. Each configuration is applied through an additional content-script and the signature is extracted from a mutation observer.
